1.109  Fixed various lacks of backwards incompatibility in Tk804
	Added a 'bug report' item to the File menu.

1.1084 Changed the 'bareword' and bareword options for widgets and pack to -bareword
       to support Tk804.024


1.1083   A perl debugger package is required to define a subroutine name 'sub'. 
This routine is a 'proxy' for handling subroutine calls and allows the
debugger pacakage to track subroutine depth so that it can implement
'step over', 'step in' and 'return' functionality.  It must also handle
the same context as the proxied routine; it must return a scalar where a
scalar was being expected, an array where an array is being expected and
a void where a void was being expected.  Ptkdb was not handling the case
for void.  99.9% of the time this will have no ill effects although it
is being handled incorrectly. 

1.1075   Fix for perl 5.8.0.  Fixes to doc formatting.  $^W saves now done
         with local($^W).  Overdue correction for @_ context save.


1.1075beta   Expedient fix for perl 5.8.0


1.1074  Fixed deficiency where the 'Exprs' pane would not display or decomposed the 
        members of a blessed array.  

1.1073  Added key shortcuts.  Added 'white' foreground to the 'stoppt' tag to make text more visible.  
	Experimental feature that checks for and tries to install Tk if it's missing.  

1.1072  Added feature that delays loading of the subs page until the notebook page is brought forward

1.107   Release

1.1068  Fixed a minor warning put out by pod2man during installation that's been grating
        on the terminally pedantic.  

        Data::Dumper is now a requirement for running.  This has been included with perl
        since 5.00505.

1.1067  Fixed a problem where ptkdb would not evaluate an expression such as 'keys %hash' in
	its expression window.

	Fixed some problems with balloons coordinate system and made them respond faster.

1.1063  Menu initialization has been 'tuned' up a bit.   New handling for closure of window
        and quit.  Beginning to deal with 'reused' addresses.

1.1059  Corrected a bug where vars in the dbval subroutine could eclipse
        vars that were in targe code

1.1052  Added a configuration option that allows users to change
        the packing arrangement of the code and notebook panes.  
	Use xresource ptkdb*codeside: left|right|top|bottom
        Or environmental var PTKDB_CODE_SIDE=left|right|top|bottom

        See POD section item:  PTKDB_CODE_SIDE

1.105   Fixed incorrect evaluation of $@ in expressions.
        Corrected some formatting issues with the POD section.

1.104


	Fixed a conflict with 'qw' and perl 5.004.

        Fixed a warning issued with perl 5.004

        Corrected a problem with where using ptkdb for 
        debugging other ptk apps would cause 'grab' problems.



   This is version 1.1 of ptkdb, a debugger for perl that uses the
perlTk user interface.   It features pushbutton controls for run,
step-in, step-out, return, controls for breakpoints, expression
evaluation and package browsing.  

Installation:

   You  use the MakeMaker interface:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make install

If worse comes to worse you can simply copy the ptkdb.pm file into 
cp ptkdb.pm /usr/local/lib/perl5/5.xxx/Devel/ptkdb.pm

On Windows:

copy ptkdb.pm C:\perl\5.x\lib\Devel\ptkdb.pm

To Test:

perl -d:ptkdb -e 1




Installing Tk:

   In order to use ptkdb you must first install PerlTk.

Using the CPAN module:

   perl -MCPAN -e "install Tk"

Using the Active State PPM Module:

   ppm
   > install Tk

      or

   retrieve the latest Tk archive from CPAN (Tk800.022 as of this writing)

   http://www.perl.com/CPAN/modules/by-category/08_User_Interfaces/Tk/

UNIX:

   gunzip Tk800.022.tar.gz
   tar xf Tk800.022.tar
   cd Tk800.022
   perl Makefile.PL
   make 
# This may require su or root permissions
   make install

Win32:

   # Unix WinZip to extract the Tk archive
   using Visual C++:

   perl Makefile.PL
   nmake 
   nmake install
